# ðŸŒ¿ Plantbase

Plantbase is a plant information platform that aims to **collect**, **organize** and **publish** accurate information on how to properly take care of your houseplants.

The goal of this project is to cut through the misinformation and provide a clear guide on how to tend to your plants.

Our growing database contains detailed information sheets, photos and care instructions for over 30 popular houseplants.

We strongly believe that plant care information should be **free**, and **rooted in science**.</p>

You can access plantbase on [https://houseplantguide.org/](https://houseplantguide.org/)

## How to access the data

All plant data (species, genera, familiae) can be found in the plant-base repository within the /data folder. Each species/genus/family is stored as a `markdown` file.

## How to contribute

To contribute, you can create a fork of the plant-base repository and create a PR (pull request) with your changes to the plant data.

If you are not familiar with forking or making PRs, you can use the following form [https://tally.so/r/nGg9kz](https://tally.so/r/nGg9kz) to request the addition of a plant instead.

Please only submit houseplants.

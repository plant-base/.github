## Data

All plant data (species, genera, familiae) can be found in the plant-base repository within the /data folder. Each species/genus/family is stored as a `markdown` file.

## Contribute

To contribute, you can create a fork of the plant-base repository and create a PR (pull request) with your changes to the plant data.

If you are not familiar with forking or making PRs, you can use the following form [https://tally.so/r/nGg9kz](https://tally.so/r/nGg9kz) to request the addition of a plant instead.
